----------------------------TASK 2Answers   ------------------------------------
1) Write a query to find the root node
1.SELECT
    id, title
FROM
    shop
WHERE
    parent_id IS NULL;







2) Write a query to find leaf node.
2.SELECT
    s1.id, s1.title
FROM
    shop s1
        LEFT JOIN
    shop s2 ON s2.parent_id = s1.id
WHERE
    s2.id IS NULL;




3) Write a query to find non-leaf node.

3.SELECT
   DISTINCT( s1.id), s1.title
FROM
    shop s1
        INNER JOIN
    shop s2 ON s2.parent_id = s1.id
WHERE
    s2.id IS NOT NULL









4) Write a query to find the path of each node. 
4.WITH RECURSIVE shop_path (id, title, path) AS
(
  SELECT id, title, title as path
    FROM shop
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT c.id, c.title, CONCAT(cp.path, ' > ', c.title)
    FROM shop_path AS cp JOIN shop AS c
      ON cp.id = c.parent_id
)
SELECT * FROM shop_path
ORDER BY path





5) Write a function to calculate node level. e.g. Electronics is at 0 level, Camera is on level 2 and iOs is on level 3.
5.WITH RECURSIVE shop_path (id, title, lvl) AS
(
  SELECT id, title, 0 lvl
    FROM shop
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT c.id, c.title,cp.lvl + 1
    FROM shop_path AS cp JOIN shop AS c
      ON cp.id = c.parent_id
)
SELECT * FROM shop_path
ORDER BY lvl








6) Write a procedure to get the immediate children
6.CREATE PROCEDURE `myf`(IN `mid` INT(5)) NOT DETERMINISTIC NO SQL SQL SECURITY DEFINER BEGIN select id,title from shop where id=mid; END
